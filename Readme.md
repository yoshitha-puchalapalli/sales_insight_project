# Sales Insight Dashboard

Welcome to the **Sales Insight Dashboard** repository! This project combines the powerful data visualization capabilities of Power BI with a robust backend data cleaning pipeline implemented in MySQL. The goal is to deliver a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights into sales performance, ensuring businesses can make informed decisions based on reliable data.

## Features

- **Powerful Data Visualization**: Create dynamic and visually appealing charts, graphs, and tables with Power BI to offer a clear overview of sales data.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to interact with the data, apply filters, and drill down into specific metrics for deeper analysis.
- **MySQL Data Cleaning Pipeline**: Implement a robust pipeline for data cleaning and transformation using MySQL, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and error-free data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats to maintain data integrity.
- **Optimized Querying**: Use efficient SQL queries to extract and aggregate data, maintaining smooth performance even with large datasets.
- **Data Transformation**: Apply data transformation techniques to derive additional insights or create calculated columns.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement mechanisms for real-time or scheduled updates to keep the dashboard current and relevant.
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation on setting up both the Power BI dashboard and the MySQL data cleaning pipeline.
